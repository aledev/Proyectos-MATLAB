Here you will find some MATLAB scripts that I use at university.

Script Details:

- "Lab1A1.m" shows a chart for the following function: 7log5(2x+3)
- "Lab1A2.m" shows a chart for the following functions: 7log5(2x+3) and sin(13*(log7(x+2)))
- "Lab1A3.m" shows a chart for the following function: sin(13*(log7(x+2)))
- "Lab1B1.m" shows a chart in normal scale for the following function: 2x*e^(5x-7)
- "Lab1B2.m" shows a chart in log scale for the following function: 2x*e^(5x-7)
- "Lab1C1_NewtonRap.m" shows the root for a function using Newton-Raphson Method. It needs 4 parameters to work: function, iterations, tolerance, an initial point. This method use recursion to calculate the root. 
  If you want to test this Newton-Raphson method, here is an example command call: "Lab1C1_NewtonRap('x^3-x-1', 4, 0.00001, 1);".

Hope that some of these scripts helps you ;)!
